1.                   The   band-gap   reference   shown   below   is   designed   to   have   nominally   zero   TCF       at25°C.    Due   to   process   variations, the   saturation   current   IS      of   the   transistors   is   actu-   ally   twice   the   nominal   value.      Assume      VOS         =   0.       What      is      dVOUT   /dT      at      25°C?   Neglect base currents.


2.                   Simulate   the   band-gap   reference    from   the   previous   problem   on   SPICE.      Assume   that the ampliﬁer is   just a voltage-controlled   voltage   source   with   an   open-loop   gain   of   10,000 and   that   the   resistor   values   are   independent   of   temperature.      Also   assume that   IS1      =   1.   25 × 10−17    A   and   IS2       =   1 × 10−16    A.    In   SPICE,   adjust the   closed-loop   gain of   the ampliﬁer (by choosing suitable resistor   values)   so   that   the   output   TCF      is   zero   at   25°C.    What   is   the   resulting   target   value代 写EEC 210 Analysis and design of analog integrated circuits HW 5R
代做程序编程语言   of   VOUT?    Now   double   IS1      and   IS2   .   Use   SPICE   to   adjust   the   gain   so   that   VOUT    is   equal   to   the   target   at   25°C.    Find the   new   dVOUT   /dT    at   25°C   with   SPICE.      Compare   this   result   with   the   calculations from the previous problem.
3.                   Calculate the bias current of   the circuit   shown   below   as   a   function   of   R,   µn   Cox ,   and   the   device   sizes.      Comment   on   the   temperature   behavior   of the   bias   current.      For   simplicity, assume that Xd       = Ld       =   0 and ignore the body   effect.

4.                   The    circuit   used    in   the   previous   problem   produces   a    supply-insensitive   current.   Calculate   the   ratio   of   small-signal   variations   in   IBIAS      to   small-signal   variations   in VDD      at   low   frequencies.      Ignore   the   body   effect   but   include   ﬁnite   transistor   ro      in   this calculation.
